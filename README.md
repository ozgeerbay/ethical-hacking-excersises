# Exploitation Techniques – Course Exercises Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **exercise write-ups and lab examples**
based on the **exploitation and offensive security topics covered during the course**.

The materials are derived from:
- In-class demonstrations
- Hands-on laboratory environments
- Course reference materials and textbooks

The purpose of this repository is **educational**:  
to document techniques discussed during lectures and labs, and to demonstrate
understanding of common vulnerability classes and attack methodologies.

## Topics Covered
The repository includes examples from multiple domains of exploitation:

### Binary Exploitation
- Buffer overflow (authentication logic abuse)
- Format string vulnerability
- Return-to-libc (ret2libc) technique

### Web Exploitation
- SQL Injection (authentication bypass)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Network & Service Reconnaissance and Exploitation
- Exploiting vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor
- Idle (Zombie) scan

### Password Attacks
- Online brute-force attacks using Hydra

### Post-Exploitation
- Windows XP exploitation using Metasploit
- Session handling and persistence concepts

## Repository Structure
Each file represents a **self-contained exercise write-up**, typically including:
- A short vulnerability or technique description
- Relevant code or configuration snippets
- Commands used during exploitation
- Expected outcomes or verification steps
